## Installation process

### 1. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox

- [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install)

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

### 2. Build the P4 virtual machine

Clone the oficial repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials.git
```

```
cd tutorial/vm-ubuntu-20.04
```
Run the following command:

```
vagrant up
```

### 3. Adjust the P4 VM settings

Turn off the machine, and extend the number of cores and memory size so it does not crash during the experiments.

For the experiments we used a DELL server with a significant amount of cores and memory. For the P4 VM we defined:
- 22 vCPU cores
- 146 GB of memory

We did not experiment with smaller configuration values. If using smaller configuration values, do one round of experiments and compare the number of packets processesd by the source switch. If the egress number of packets is considerably smaller than the input for any input PCAP, you need to increase the memory space or number of cores.

### 4. Log into the machine and clone this repository

```
sudo apt update && cd Documents
```

```
git clone  https://github.com/HenriqueBBrum/Network-Wide-Rule-Orchestrator.git && cd Network-Wide-Rule-Orchestrator
```

### 5. Download the CIC-IDS-2017 PCAP files and create a shared folder with the guest system

To dowload them, go to [this link](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html), and scroll down to the end of the page. Click the `Download this dataset` and fill in the required information. Finally, enter the `CIC-IDS-2017` directory, then the `PCAPs` directory, and download the PCAP for each day of the week. They are big PCAPs, with over 8GB of data, so they take a while to download.

Save them into your host machine in one folder. For the guest folder, it must be named `CICIDS2017-PCAPS` and placed at the same level as this repo's folder. The image below illustrates this:

- [How to create shared folder for virtual machine on VirtualBox](https://pureinfotech.com/create-shared-folder-virtual-machine-virtualbox/)


### 6. Install the dependencies

The last step is to run the follwoing command to automatically install all required dependencies and configure the enviroment:

```
./install_dependencies.sh
```

> :warning: This script takes a long time to finish, be patitent.

The packages and tools installed are the following:
- tcpreplay
- matplotlib and networkx (Python)
- BMv2 (for custom high performance)
- Snort3

After this process ends, the enviroment is configured and ready to run the experiments.

## Replicating the experiments

There are two set of experiments to replicate: the data plane parameters evaluation[](), and the final evaluation. The first evaluates different data plane configurations while the latter evalaute the network-wide distribution algorithms in two topology scenarios with diffferent memoery avialbilty in the switches.


### Data plane parameters evaluation

uncomment    switch.SetForwardingPipelineConfig(p4info=p4info_helper.p4info, bmv2_json_file_path=bmv2_json)
			 print("Installed P4 Program using SetForwardingPipelineConfig on switch "+switch_id)

uncomment         standard_metadata.egress_spec = DEFAULT_PORT;
comment ipv4_lpm.apply();

Pass the fullpath to the output folder


### Final evaluation experiments


### Run individual experiments


## Obtaining the baseline alerts

The baseline alerts used to compare against the experiments, were obtained through the following method:

```
snort -c snort.lua --rule-path <rule-path> -R <pcap-file> -A alert_json --lua "alert_json = {file = true}"
```

This command receives as input a ruleset, and the input PCAP. The ouput alerts file is saveed at...
